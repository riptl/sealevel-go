  <p>
    <strong>Go library embedding the Solana Sealevel runtime</strong>
  </p>
  <sub>Built with Go and ü¶Ä at <em>REDACTED</em></sub>
</div>

## Summary

This Go library allows you to execute Solana bytecode format programs without a blockchain node.

It interfaces with `libsealevel`, the C library wrapping `solana-bpf-program-loader` and `solana_rbpf`.

## How to build

sealevel-go is under heavy development. Ô∏èü¶∫

To run, you'll need to ‚Ä¶
- build `libsealevel` from Solana sources;
- install headers and shared library to your path;

```shell
# Check out `libsealevel`.
git clone https://github.com/terorie/libsealevel
cd libsealevel

# Build libsealevel
cargo build --release

# Install header
ln -s "$(pwd)/sealevel.h" /usr/local/include/sealevel.h

# Install library (Linux)
ln -s "$(pwd)/target/release/libsealevel.dylib" /usr/local/lib/libsealevel.dylib
# Install library (macOS)
ln -s "$(pwd)/target/release/libsealevel.so" /usr/local/lib/libsealevel.so
```

Then, simply Go build as usual.

```shell
go vet .
go build .
go test .
```
